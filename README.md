# Robot_bid
I test various API, Selenium automatic auction implementations, unprofessional but functional
an automatic bid implementation using selenium for Ebay, configured for bidding in the last seconds

there is no frontend part, in the source you enter the link of the product to be bought, 
the user and the password, you can also set how many seconds before the expiration to make the bid
